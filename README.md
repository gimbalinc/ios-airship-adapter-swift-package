## Installation
To add this Swift package to your XCode project, in XCode go to `File` -> `Add packages`, then enter into the search bar the git URL to this repository. Select this package by name, then click `Add Package`.

## Usage

### Importing

#### Swift

```
import AirshipAdapter
```

#### Obj-C

```
@import AirshipAdapter
```

### Enabling Event Tracking
By default, event tracking is disabled, and thus must be explicitly enabled as described below.

##### RegionEvents
To enable or disable the tracking of Airship `RegionEvent` objects, use the  `shouldTrackRegionEvents` property:

```
AirshipAdapter.shared.shouldTrackRegionEvents = true // enabled
AirshipAdapter.shared.shouldTrackRegionEvents = false // disabled
```

##### CustomEvents
To enable or disable the tracking of Airship `CustomEvent` objects, use the `shouldTrackCustomEntryEvents` and `shouldTrackCustomExitEvents` properties to track events upon place entry and exit, as shown below. For more information regarding Airship Custom Events, see the documentation [here](https://docs.airship.com/guides/messaging/user-guide/data/custom-events/#overview).
```
// To enable CustomEvent tracking for place exits
AirshipAdapter.shared.shouldTrackCustomExitEvents = true
// To disable CustomEvent tracking for place exits
AirshipAdapter.shared.shouldTrackCustomExitEvents = false
// To enable CustomEvent tracking for place entries
AirshipAdapter.shared.shouldTrackCustomEntryEvents = true
// To disable CustomEvent tracking for place entries
AirshipAdapter.shared.shouldTrackCustomEntryEvents = false
```

### Restoring the adapter

In your application delegate call `restore` during `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`:

#### Swift

```
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {

   // after Airship.takeOff   
   AirshipGimbalAdapter.shared.restore()

   ...
}
```

#### Obj-C

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

   // after UAirship.takeOff
   [[AirshpGimbalAdapter shared] restore];

   ...
}
```

Restore will automatically resume the adapter on application launch.


### Starting the adapter

#### Swift

```
AirshipGimbalAdapter.shared.start("## PLACE YOUR API KEY HERE ##")
```

#### Obj-C
```
[[AirshpGimbalAdapter shared] start:@"## PLACE YOUR API KEY HERE ##"];
```

### Stopping the adapter

#### Swift

```
AirshipGimbalAdapter.shared.stop()
```

#### Obj-C

```
[[AirshpGimbalAdapter shared] stop];
```

### Enabling Bluetooth Warning

In the event that Bluetooth is disabled during place monitoring, the Gimbal Adapter can prompt users with an alert view
to enable Bluetooth. This functionality is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting AirshipGimbalAdapter's
`bluetoothPoweredOffAlertEnabled` property to true:

#### Swift

```
AirshipGimbalAdapter.shared.bluetoothPoweredOffAlertEnabled = true
```

#### Obj-C

```
[AirshipGimbalAdapter shared].bluetoothPoweredOffAlertEnabled = YES;
```

## AirshipGimbalAdapter Migration
The `AirshipGimbalAdapter` is an older version of this adapter; if you previously used the `AirshipGimblAdapter` and would like to migrate, see the following steps:
- If using Cocoapods, remove `AirshipGimbalAdapter` from your project
- In your code, references to the `AirshipGimbalAdapter` class should be changed to `AirshipAdapter`
- The older `AirshipGimbalAdapter` tracked Region Events but not Custom Events; if you would like to keep this type of functionality, disable `CustomEvent` tracking and enable `RegionEvent` tracking, as described above in the section entitled `Enabling Event Tracking`.
